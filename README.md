RazorAnalyzer
=============

Class for analyzing the 2015 razor ntuples

Setup
-------------
From t3-higgs:

    git clone https://github.com/RazorCMS/RazorAnalyzer.git
    cd RazorAnalyzer
    make
  
Defining a new analysis
-------------
1) Copy src/analyses/DummyAnalysis.cc and modify it to define your analyzer's behavior.  Be sure to change the name of the DummyAnalysis() function.

2) Add your analysis under "LIST OF ANALYSES" in include/RazorAnalyzer.h.

3) In src/RazorRun.cc, under "EXECUTE YOUR ANALYSIS" add the option to execute your analysis code.

Running
------------
After compiling, 

    ./RazorRun <list of input files> <analysis type>
  
Example: to execute a dummy analysis that does nothing,

    ./RazorRun lists/TTJets_List_Test.txt dummy

Normalizing the processed ntuples
------------
The NormalizeNtuple macro opens a specified set of files and adds a 'weight' branch to each TTree in each file.  The value of 'weight' is the same for all events in a tree and is equal to CrossSection/NEvents, where NEvents is the total number of events processed for the given dataset.  The cross sections can be found in the file data/xSections.dat.  To run NormalizeNtuple:

    ./NormalizeNtuple <input file>

See lists/filestonormalize/testTTJets.txt for an example input file to be used with NormalizeNtuple.

Running over many samples at once
-----------
The script 'runEverything' takes as input the name of a directory containing lists of files to process.  Ex:

    ./runEverything lists/27Oct2014/

The script will (locally) run the RazorInclusive analysis on each sample listed in the given directory, run NormalizeNtuple to add event weights, and add all of the output files together.
